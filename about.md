Hi. Today we live in the World full of social norms and social media. In the past decade people locked themselves in their own identity bubbles. I was one of them until it became clear that I lost my personal freedom, freedom to create without caring about what other people would think.

Maybe some day Max Roark will take off his mask. For now that is just a character. 
A character with his own ambitions.
